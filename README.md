  # Project 2 Farming Quiz For Kids!
  ## Purpose
  This website was created for the sole purpose of completing the second project for the Code Institues's Full Stack Developer Course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses, Scrimba course and YouTube videos. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document. The Farming Quiz For Kids site was built as a simple quiz for children all about farming in order to teach children about farming whilst having fun playing. The site is targeted at children, using bright colours, fun images and simple questions on an easy to use interface which allows the child to navigate through the questions, play again or return to the home page. The page is personal, allowing the child to enter thier name and return it giving an encouraging message at the end of the game.

  The live website can be found [here] (https://jax-parker.github.io/Farming_Quiz_For_Kids/).

## Structure
All pages will have big buttons with easy to read functions allowing you to navigate through the game easily and two bright buttons to explain if the answers are correct or incorrect with correlating colours with the answers when clicked on. The fonts will be easy to read. The background will be colourful with animated farm animals to appeal to children and the interface will be easy to use so that younger children can play too.

### The child will be able to enter their name through the input box in order to receive and encouraging message at the end. 
The purpose of this is to fulfil user story:<br>
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand how to enter my name.<br>
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand how to start the quiz.<br>
> As a returning visitor, I want to be familiar with the site and use my experience to to navigate through the quiz.<br>
> As a frequent visitor, I want to be familiar with the site and use my experience to to navigate through the quiz.<br>
![Start Section](assets/readme-images/start-section.png)

### The child will be able to clearly read the questions, click on an answer and use the colours of the boxes to match with the colours of the menu underneath to see if their answer was correct or incorrect.

> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand if my question was correct or incorrect.<br>

> As a first time visitor, I want to use the site to improve my knowledge of farming.<br>
> As a returning  and frequent visitor, I want to be familiar with the site and use my experience to to navigate through the quiz.<br>
> As a returning and frequent visitor, I want to use the site to improve m y knowledge of farming.<br>
![Question Section](assets/readme-images/question-section.png)

### The child will be able to see an encouraging message at the end of the game which is personalised to them. They will then have a choice to replay the game or navigate back to the start.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The colours used compliment or match the farm background and are bright and colourful for children. The darker green for the title and message, the brown for the buttons, the light green and red for correct and incorrect, the gold for the hover colour and the black for borders. The grey is used instead of white for text/backgrounds to give a softer look.<br>
![Hex Colors](assets/readme-images/hex-colors.png)
#### Typography
The title and message font used are **Caveat** which is cursive to give a fun, informal look. All other text used is **Open Sans** with letter spacing to ensure it is easy to read for children. Both fonts were imported from Google Fonts.<br>
![Fonts Used](assets/readme-images/fonts.png)
#### Imagery
The background image and favicon were chosen for their fun, friendly, comic nature to appeal to children. The favicon used I already had in my stock images (originally found on the internet) and the background was a license free image from HiClipart and can be found [here](https://www.hiclipart.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-ivjgh).

#### Wireframes
Created using Publisher as Balsamiq now charge.
![Wireframes](assets/readme-images/wireframe-pages.png)
# Differences to design
After comparing the original wireframe designs to the finished website;
* Start section<br>
  The wireframe, although had boxes for images did not show a background image. There was very little difference in design, although the start button appeared underneath the name input box to keep everything centered and the answer boxes were side by side.
* Question Section<br>
  Again there was very little difference to the original design, although the responsivness on mobile kept the original layout and was still easy to read.
* Message Section<br>
  Layout was again, similar to the wireframe. I ensured that the name return was on a separate line to stand out.

### Existing Features
- The website has three sections, the start section where the player can enter their name, the question section, where the player can read and click on their choice of answer then click next for the next question and a message section, where the player gets a message which includes their name. The player can then replay the game or return to the start section where someone else can enter their name and play or they can play again.

### Features Left to Implement
- Add scoring to the question section so the player knows which question they are on and how many are incorrect or correct.
- Maybe add a high scores section that keeps a record of who has played and what score they achieved.

# Testing

#### Summary
The live project can be found [Here](https://jax-parker.github.io/Farming_Quiz_For_Kids/)<br>
This project is front end only with no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects, layout and the correct operation of the quiz. Testing to be done on at least three browsers and all screen sizes.

No elements should overlap another container div.

All buttons should work with the appropriate function.

## Accessibility

Accessibility has been taken into account throughout the design of this website to make it user friendly. This has been achieved by:<br>
  * Using semantic HTML
  * Using a hover state on buttons to ensure clarity to the user of which one they are about to click.
  * Choosing a sans serif font for questions and instructions for easy to read purposes for children and children with dyslexsia.
  * Choosing bright contrasting colours to give clarity to navigation and readability. After running through Google Lighthouse    though the button colours were deemed inaccessable to readers so I used Deque University website to change the colours to a more accessible read. Webite can be found [here](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/color-contrast?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)<br>
  * Google Lighthouse retest after colour changes<br>
