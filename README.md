  # Project 2 Farming Quiz For Kids!
  ## Purpose
  This website was created for the sole purpose of completing the second project for the Code Institues's Full Stack Developer Course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses, Scrimba course and YouTube videos. A full list of technologies used can be found in the technologies section of this document. The Farming Quiz For Kids site was built as a simple quiz for children all about farming in order to teach children about farming whilst having fun playing. The site is targeted at children, using bright colours, fun images and simple questions on an easy to use interface which allows the child to navigate through the questions, play again or return to the home page. The page is personal, allowing the child to enter their name and return it giving an encouraging message at the end of the game.

  The live website can be found [here] (https://jax-parker.github.io/Farming_Quiz_For_Kids/).

## Structure
All pages will have big buttons with easy to read functions allowing you to navigate through the game easily and two bright buttons to explain if the answers are correct or incorrect with correlating colours with the answers when clicked on. The fonts will be easy to read. The background will be colourful with cartoon farm animals to appeal to children and the interface will be easy to use so that younger children can play too.

### The child will be able to enter their name through the input box in order to receive and encouraging message at the end. 
The purpose of this is to fulfil user story:<br>
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand how to enter my name.<br>
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand how to start the quiz.<br>
> As a returning visitor, I want to be familiar with the site and use my experience to to navigate through the quiz.<br>
> As a frequent visitor, I want to be familiar with the site and use my experience to to navigate through the quiz.<br>
![Start Section](assets/readme-images/start-section.png)

### The child will be able to clearly read the questions, click on an answer and use the colours of the boxes to match with the colours of the menu underneath to see if their answer was correct or incorrect.
The purpose of this is to fulfil user story:<br>
> As a first time visitor, I want to be able to understand if my question was correct or incorrect & see my score.<br>

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
The colours used compliment or match the farm background and are bright and colourful for children. The darker green for the title and message, the brown for the buttons, the light green and red for correct and incorrect, the gold for the hover colour and the black for borders. The grey is used instead of white for text/backgrounds to give a softer look.<br>
![Hex Colors](assets/readme-images/hex-colors.png)
#### Typography
The title and message font used are **Caveat** which is cursive to give a fun, informal look. All other text used is **Open Sans** with letter spacing to ensure it is easy to read for children. Both fonts were imported from Google Fonts.<br>
![Fonts Used](assets/readme-images/fonts.png)
#### Imagery
The background image and favicon were chosen for their fun, friendly, comic nature to appeal to children. The favicon used I already had in my stock images (originally found on the internet) and the background was a license free image from HiClipart and can be found [here](https://www.hiclipart.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-ivjgh).

#### Wireframes
Created using Publisher as Balsamiq now charge.
![Wireframes](assets/readme-images/wireframe-pages.png)
# Differences to design
After comparing the original wireframe designs to the finished website;
* Start section<br>
  The wireframe, although had boxes for images did not show a background image. There was very little difference in design, although the start button appeared underneath the name input box to keep everything centered and the answer boxes were side by side.
* Question Section<br>
  Again there was very little difference to the original design, although the responsivness on mobile kept the original layout and was still easy to read.
* Message Section<br>
  Layout was again, similar to the wireframe. I ensured that the name return was on a separate line to stand out.

### Existing Features
- The website has three sections, the start section where the player can enter their name, the question section, where the player can read and click on their choice of answer then click next for the next question and a message section, where the player gets a message which includes their name. The player can then replay the game or return to the start section where someone else can enter their name and play or they can play again.

### Features Left to Implement
- Add scoring to the question section so the player knows which question they are on and how many are incorrect or correct.
- Maybe add a high scores section that keeps a record of who has played and what score they achieved.

# Testing

## Summary
The live project can be found [Here](https://jax-parker.github.io/Farming_Quiz_For_Kids/)<br>
This project is front end only with no back-end functionality, the testing performed will be on the visual effects, layout and the correct operation of the quiz. Testing to be done on at least three browsers and all screen sizes.

No elements should overlap another container div.

All buttons should work with the appropriate function.

## Accessibility Testing

Accessibility has been taken into account throughout the design of this website to make it user friendly. This has been achieved by:<br>
  * Using semantic HTML
  * Using a border colour change to ensure user knows which answer was picked after answer colour styling.
  * Choosing a sans serif font for questions and instructions for easy to read purposes for children and children with dyslexsia.
  * Choosing bright contrasting colours to give clarity to navigation and readability. After running through Google Lighthouse    though the button colours were deemed inaccessable to readers so I used Deque University website to change the colours to a more accessible read. Webite can be found [here](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.4/color-contrast?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools)<br>
  * Google Lighthouse retest after colour changes<br>
  ![Google lighthouse](assets/readme-images/lighthouse-score.png) 
  * To validate web accessibility the website was tested on [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/). Aria labels were missing for the page and the input box so these were added and retested with one error for an empty H1 which is created in JavaScript so not amended.<br>
  ![Wave](assets/readme-images/wave-report.png)

 ## Validation Testing
 * HTML - tested through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and showed an empty header but this is created in JavaScript therefore not amended.<br>
 ![W3C HTML Test](assets/readme-images/html-checker.png)
 * CSS - tested through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) and no errors were found.<br>
 ![W3C CSS Validator](assets/readme-images/css-checker.png)
 * JavaScript - tested through the [Jshint.com](https://jshint.com) and no errors were found.<br>
 ![Jshint Test](assets/readme-images/jshint-test.png)

## Function Testing
The site was tested for responsiveness at [Am I Responsive Ready](https://amiresponsiveready.com/check/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjax-parker.github.io%2FFarming_Quiz_For_Kids%2F) which shows the site, portrait and landscape on different types of platforms.
* Validation tests were run as below for user experience.

![](assets/readme-images/test-report-farming-quiz_Page_2.png)
![](assets/readme-images/test-report-farming-quiz_Page_3.png)

## Issues and Resolutions to issues found during testing
* Responsiveness on small screens caused title to be lost on right edge. This was resolved by adjusting the rem size in media queries(CSS).
* Yellow border was not big enough on selected answer. This was resolved by making the border pixels larger.
* Correct/Incorrect buttons colour was deemed to be insufficient in contrast. This was resolved by using the Deque University website to find suitable colours and changed CSS.
* Scores did not reset when replay button was clicked. This was resolved by setting the inner text of the score/incorrect to zero.
* Proof read though and amend spelling mistakes.
* No delay between the last question and the message. This was resolved by adding a setTimout to the question loop.

## Deployment

### Project Creation
The project was started by opening my Github profile page, clicking on repositories and new. I chose the Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template from my template drop down box and named my repository Farming_Quiz_For_Kids. I checked the Public radio button and create repository.
